    <p>Welcome to the Widom Lab!</p>
    <p>We are a physical chemistry research group at the University of Oregon in beautiful Eugene, OR. 
        We use spectroscopy to study the folding mechanisms of RNA molecules whose structures are important for their biological functions. 
        Check out the <a href="/research">research</a> tab for a more detailed description of our work in this very exciting field of study. 
        If youâ€™re interested in our work, please <a href="/contact"> get in touch</a>.</p>
